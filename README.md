You want open source, smart, bluetooth enabled, LED juggling props?! Well, you're at the right place. However, this project is very much in its infancy. You can't buy any props and even making them is a bit tricky just now. I still think the code should be available so it's all here.

What can your juggling balls do?
The juggling balls are wirelessly connected and can detect if they are in your hand or in the air. A simple effect is changing colour every time they are thrown. A more advanced version is when all balls thrown at an instance change to the same random colour. The balls can flash and fade as well as staying a solid colour. All of this can be controlled through your computer or bluetooth-enabled Android phone. No more annoying button tapping to program your props! :)
